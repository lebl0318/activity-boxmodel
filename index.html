        <h1>Mercury in Fish</h1>

        <p>Fish and shellfish are an important part of a healthy diet. Both contain high-quality protein and other essential nutrients, are low in saturated fat, and contain omega-3 fatty acids. A well-balanced diet that includes fish can help contribute to heart health and children's proper growth and development.</p>

        <p><strong>However, nearly all fish contain traces of mercury.</strong> For most people, the risk is not a major health concern. But, some fish contain higher levels of mercury that may harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system. The risks depend on the amount of fish eaten and its levels of mercury.</p>
        
        <p>The following <strong>recommendations</strong> can help in the selection of lower-risk seafood: </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><em>Do not</em> eat Shark, Swordfish, King Mackerel, or Tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury.</li>
            <li>Eat up to 12 ounces, or 2 meals, a week of a variety of fish that are lower in mercury.</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Five of the most common fish that are low in mercury are shrimp, canned light tuna, salmon, pollock, and catfish.</li>
            <li>Albacore "white" tuna has more mercury than canned light tuna, so only allow 6 ounces per week.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Be sure to regularly check local advisories regarding the safety of fish caught by family and friends in your local waters. If no advice is available, eat up to 6 ounces per week, but don't consume any other fish during that week.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p><em>Follow these same recommendations when feeding fish to young child, but in smaller portions.</em></p>
